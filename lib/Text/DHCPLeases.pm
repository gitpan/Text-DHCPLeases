=head1 NAME

Text::DHCPLeases - Parse DHCP leases file from ISC dhcpd.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Text::DHCPLeases;

    my $leases = Text::DHCPLeases->new("/etc/dhcpd.leases");

    foreach my $obj ( $leases->get_objects ){
        print $obj->name;
        if ( $obj->binding_state eq 'active' ){
           ...
    }
    ...

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module provides an object-oriented interface to ISC DHCPD leases files.  
The goal is to objectify all declarations, as defined by the ISC dhcpd package man pages.

This interface is useful for analyzing, reporting, converting lease files, 
or as a tool for other applications that need to import dhcpd lease data structures.

=head2 new - Class Constructor

  Arguments:
    Hash with the following keys:
    file  -  Leases file path
  Returns:
    Text::DHCPLeases object
  Examples:
    Text::DHCPLeases->new(file=>"/etc/dhcpd.leases");

  Arguments:
    Object attributes to match (optional)
  Returns:

=head1 BUGS AND LIMITATIONS

Correct parsing of leases files depends on changes made to the format of
said files by the authors of the ISC DHCPD package.  This module was tested
against leases files generated by ISC DHCPD version 3.1.0.  In addition, I
do not have access to leases file with all possible declarations and statements,
so parsing could be broken in some circumstances.  Patches are welcome.

No bugs have been reported.

Please report any bugs or feature requests to
